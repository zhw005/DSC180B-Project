## Introduction
In our project, we will be focusing on using different techniques from causal inferences and explainable AI to interpret various machine learning models across various domains. In particular, we are interested in three domains - healthcare, banking, and the housing market. Within each domain, we are going to train several machine learning models first:XGBoost, LightGBM, TabNet, and SVM. And we have three goals in general: 1) Explaining black-box models in general and finding out to what extent the learning models agree and disagree with each other in terms of predictive multiplicity and FN/FP predictions; 2) assessing the fairness of each learning algorithm; 3) Generating recourse for individuals - a set of minimal actions to change the prediction of those black-box models. To evaluate our explanations on those black-box models, we are going to compare the usability of each explanation model using domain knowledge, justifying which method gives more informative and human-understandable explanations.
